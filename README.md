# ðŸ‘‹ Hello World

I am a Software developer, passionate about technology and minimalism, based in Venezuela. 
Most of my professional experience involves [backend development](https://github.com/topics/backend) and a some front, working as a contractor. 

I use `Python3` with `typing` and doc-strings, following best practices like PEP-8 and design patterns. 
A lot of my daily tasks are automated by both Python and `Bash` scripts. 

Currently working as solopreneur in multiple micro SaaS projects.
