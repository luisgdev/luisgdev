# ðŸ‘‹ Hello World

Self-motivated Software developer based in Venezuela. 
Specialising in [backend development](https://github.com/topics/backend), 
with an eager interest in [microservices](https://github.com/topics/microservices).
I use Python with typing and doc-strings, following best practices like PEP-8 and design patterns.
Most of my work is in private repos. Currently working as solopreneur in micro SaaS projects.
